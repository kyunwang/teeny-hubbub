# Teeny hub(bub)

A hub with experiments and small things to try. (Guess mostly web based stuff).

**Disclaimer: No well thought out writing to be found here**

# Now
Will be looking around codrops and other places(might make  a small list?) and check out how stuff is being made. Kinda reverse engineer it to learn about it I guess.

Slowly checking how gatsby can be used as 'provider/host' to link towards static projects. Maybe just link to a differently build static project internally. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

*What hubbub?*
Hubbub: a chaotic din caused by a crowd of people. (by google)

I named it like this because, well... It will likely be a chaotic hub, thus hubbub.
